npm instal --save sequelize
sequelize also need mysql2 package

mysql we have create table in workbench and we linked it.
but in sequelize, it will create table by itself.so we should create a model in javascript line 
check in database.js - create connection
check model/cart.js or product.js - creating a model 

atlast in app.js we're initialising

/*associaton*/
//User created this Product       
//{..condition..} is optional , how the relation should be, if user deleted then related product also deleted
ProductModel.belongsTo(UserModel, { constraints: true, onDelete: 'CASCADE'});
UserModel.hasMany(ProductModel);//one user has many product 
/*we already created Product table it will not overwrite new info. so we have force it by setting sync( force: true)*/

/*it sync model in database by creating the appropriate table*/
sequelize
.sync( {force : true })

force :true should be used once to alter any table relation. because it will delete all content of table for each execution
check table now product table will have userid (linked)
