in general when we click delete on web, on server side we will delete that product and redirect it.
here 
in admin Product.ejs

<form action="/admin/delete-product" method="POST">       
//urlencoded will access this data
to
//now function is called which is written is admin.js(public folder) and is imported at last of this ejs file ((<script src="/js/admin.js"></script>))
<button class="btn" type="button" onclick="deleteProduct(this)">Delete</button>

from submit to button
<button class="btn" type="button">Delete</button>
............................................................
understanding:
admin product page ,we have statically servred /public/js/admin.js(delete call in admin.js is called when delete pressed admin/produc page)in which query selectore is used, 
which mean when delete is pressed now browser wont request url instead now queryselector in admin.js handle the req(chk image where admin.js servered.)
now fetch in admin.js send request and wait for response. 
product is deleted. but the result will be changed only after refresh, so for this bug we have remove html article of that product for instant update
/public/js/admin.js
uses query selector to controll dom

since the deleted product in controller have to handle in client side ,so
const productElement = btn.closest('article');
productElement.parentNode.removeChild(productElement);
 done. chk image

in route
since we used javascript request so we used route.delete instead of .post

and in controller,
we send json message to browser.(so delete product without reload)
