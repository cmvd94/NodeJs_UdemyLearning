To use ES module for import and export. instead of require() and exports used in nodejs.
 import express from express
 should use .mjs as extension or in package.json add   "type": "module" 
 IMPORTANT: gobal variable ie __dirname , __filename is NOT defined in ES modules.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PROMISES
  when nodejs is created , promises was not there ,
  so we used call back approach
  fs.readfile('filename','utf8', (err, data) => {

  })
  now many api has promises check doc. and few still in callback
    we can use thenable or also async await .
    const fs = require('fs').promises
    or
    import fs from 'fs/promises'
