/*POST after pressing login store in db*/
exports.postLogin = ( req, res, next ) => {
    req.isLoggedIn = true;
    //so we have set isAuthenticated for all render call.(ie shop and admin controller)
    //in navigation.ejs .. if authentication is true then admin add-product and list of product will be displayed in navigation bar
    //problem is even when is set isLoggendIn true here and assigning it to all res.sender it wont work
    //bcz each req from user is independent so now we're setiing it to true in current login request.
    //it response send or redirect it will eventually send  a new get request which total independent ,so that set will be expired 
    //check ..setting true . then redirected , we wont get admin navig area
    res.redirect('/');
}
.......
so we have set GlobalVariable for authentication is confirmed,
but the problem . the variable wil be shared across all request and also btw all user
..so COOKIES are used ... store data of single user in browser. which customise to the user and
sent with request that i have authentication

//check inspect->application->cookies.
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie','LoggedIn = true')
set-cookie is syntax.. loggedIn name which we keep
session when browser closed cookie erased.

browser automatically send cookie with user request . under req header
console.log(req.get('Cookie'))

problem is we can manupulate cookie in browser but just editting its value.
so storind senstive data is not ideal.

we can use cookie for tracking user.
our cookie can sent to other page.. tracking-pixel

configure cookie:

res.setHeader('Set-Cookie','LoggedIn = true; Expires =   ')
res.setHeader('Set-Cookie','LoggedIn = true'; Max-Age=  ')//in second
res.setHeader('Set-Cookie','LoggedIn = true; Domain= ')//to which cookie to sent
res.setHeader('Set-Cookie','LoggedIn = true; Secure')//works only in https

res.setHeader('Set-Cookie','LoggedIn = true; HttpOnly')//we can access cookie from client side javascript running in browser

there are package to set cookie

npm i express-session
normally session are stored in server/computer memory so its not effective way

npm i connect-mongodb-session // to store session in db
