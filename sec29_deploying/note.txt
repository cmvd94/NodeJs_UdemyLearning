Environment variable:
  1.supported by nodejs, where we can pass certain config and values into our node applicaton from outside(ie we're not hard coding certain values)
  2.values get injected when node server starts, that allow different values in development or in production.
  3.Using PROCESS object which is a Globally available in node app(node core runtime).
  4.using process.env deploying in mongodb url, port, stripe
  5.now using nodemon we can config. create a file nodemon.json . config repective value (still in development)
  6.we will not use nodemon in poduction . and also we wont restart server for every changes
  7. so in package.json script: creating "start:dev" ie dev can be any name. in which assigning nodemon 
     where as in start defining all env variable and node.js ... nodemon will fetch nodemon.json package while running
    "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "MONGO_USER=Nodejs MONGO_PASSWORD=Nodejspassword MONGO_DEFAULT_DATABASE=fileUPOWN STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_51PnXScFd0LnzjZc5DYxhtUNb4NYuxuOEUdxFaP4GPNSTVCMod2tEc454dXJlDS8d2YiHzK1pXtbwgTRyLnTqDrfB00Q5r6IiSq node app.js",
    "start:dev": "nodemon app.js"
    }  ,
  8.above code is not working in windows
    tried different methods
    https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/12198022#questions/9925546
    Now used CROSS-ENV in front 
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=poduction MONGO_USER=Nodejs MONGO_PASSWORD=Nodejspassword MONGO_DEFAULT_DATABASE=fileUPOWN STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_51PnXScFd0LnzjZc5DYxhtUNb4NYuxuOEUdxFaP4GPNSTVCMod2tEc454dXJlDS8d2YiHzK1pXtbwgTRyLnTqDrfB00Q5r6IiSq node app.js"
  9.in script NODE_ENV=poduction , expesssjs change certain things detail the error it through and optimise the code.
    our hosting provider will also set this
  10. in stripe we use testing . but in which we cant get production key

SECURE HEADER:
   1. helmet packgage.. we can secure node express applicaton
   2. added header to our package is sent
   3. app.use(helmet())

OPTIMISED ASSET/COMPRESSION:
   1.npm i compression
   2.app.use(compression())
   3.
LOGGING:
   1.npm i morgan
     app.use(morgan("combined", {stream: accessLogStream}));
SSL/TLS:
   1.securing data between client and server
   2. we can create own ssl certificate but browser will warn that used unkown ssl certificated. but in production we wil use ssl certificate provided by a known certificate authority which the browser trust
   3.now we're creating own certificate .. openssl -for mac and linux it is available in default 
     for windows: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html download
     openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert

     in windows above cmd didnt working, so do this
     Assuming you downloaded OpenSSL using the following site:
      https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
      1. Press the Windows key.
      2. Type "Path" in the search box and select "Edit the system environment variables"
      3. Click on "Environment Variables" near the bottom.
      4. In the "System Variables" section double click on the "Path" variable.
      5. Click "New" on the right-hand side.
      6. Copy and paste this into the box:
      C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin
      7. Exit out and restart your terminal (or VSCode if you're using the integrated terminal). You should be good to go from there.
   4. while config common name: is domain name... after entering details. 
            2 new file generated.   server.cert(sent to client), server.key(privatekey)
   5. check image 6,7,8

DEPLOYMENT:
   1.Git is vesion control sys- save & manage our source code. 
     commit,branch,repository...... download git for respective OS
   2.IMPORTANT in package.json add 
       "engines":{
          "node": "20.15.0"
        }
   3.then need to add code to repository. (learn more about git and github)
   4.hosted in render.com.
   5.need to add ip of hosting provider in mongo atlas. 
   6.global variable should initialised in hosting
   1.Heroku hosting provider.(now its is cost )
