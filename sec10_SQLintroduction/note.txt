1st we should create table in mysql app,link it to our applicatiob(eg database.js)

we can do it for all sort db action(ie cart, delete etc).
but queries get more and more complex when application logic becomes,
at some point we have to connect table. at present we're not that.

we can do all of that with MYSQL package. (3rd party package)
