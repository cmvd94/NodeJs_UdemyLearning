Asycn code.
   Current code we're using thenable(or callback) for Asycn operation , which is in return promise.
   .find,.countDocument, all take millisec delay which is also async code. which is return promise obj
   so once the promise Fulfilled , interlinked code will run ie .then()

for those async code we can use await

implementaion: 
 Function which has Asycn code should be defined with async prefix argument and await inside Function
 ->Current update we can use await outside async function .ie globally. previously it is not possible (should be under async fun)
 ->async fun, await , try&catch
 ->await code while executing it will convert to then and catch.
 ->so code below AWAIT will work after that await...........................
 ->imp point
     all mongoose operation we're using async await. like find,countDocument etc does not return real promise but return promise like obj which will work similar no problem in output.
     to get real promise -- await Postmodel.find().exec().. using exec it return real promise .but there is no differnece in output.
     where as bcrypt i=in default will return real promise
