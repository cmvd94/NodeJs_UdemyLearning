start -> npm start..  automatically site open in browser

understanding REACT:

for authentication topic:
   Rest API generate token once logged in.which is stored in client side.
   now for each request token has to be sent for authenticate request.
   how can we send:
      ->we cannot sent in body because GET & DELETE method does not have body.
      ->one way is we can sent in query paramter (or)
      ->we can set in header which has all meta data
      ->in this code . token  added in header
      --->SO IN GENERAL FOR EVERY FETCH , TOKEN(JWT) IS SET IN HEADER<---
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer ' + this.props.token
      }
      Authorization we can have any name, but this is a official header use of passing authentication info to backend
      why 'Bearer '. Bearer with white space. this is just convention to identify that the type of token client have.
      Bearer token is an authentication token , typically use Bearer for json

=>src->app.js(react start)

=>src->pages->feed->feed.js( responsible of starting page) in that there is couple of routes
1.loadPosts: has pagination login & handle /feed/post req
   ->pagination..in fetch url query parameter is added with page value
   
2.finishEditHandler: handle accept button in new post popup
   -> set url for new post, fetch called with url , method , data with header set application/json..(not sending data at present)
   ->now we're tring to send file(ie image). json can not handle it , because it has only text as data. so setting header application/json will lead to site crash.so now it send in formdata(rendering view.multipart form).check how it is done in code
   ->ON EDIT mode..edit url is set ..error: sending old image path, small correction is made.
3.deletePostHandler: delete post req. added url and method

4.user status handle:
   ->componentDidMount & statusUpdateHandler: regarding user status.
   ->respective url methods and data are sent
  

=>src->pages->feed->singlepost->singlepost.js( detail on single post & go to backend to fetch data) in that there is couple of routes
   -> componentDidMount: handle for single post detail. inspite of req url is set , we have set ul for image fetch

=>src->component->feed->feededit->feededit.js
    ->validating input

=>src->app.js(has signup, login, logout)
1.signupHandler: we have send data entered in form. Method,Header and body are defined.
   ->class App extends Component in which now isAuth is false// previously single we're building post .maintained we're authenticated

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
socket connection:
   ->npm i socket.io-client
   ->feed.js . in componentDidMount added openSocket('http://localhost:8080'); to create socket connection
   ->added a fun addPost in feed.js.. for client instant feed view from other client
   ->now we listen to that channel which is set in server side. and check what type of action happened create/edit , respective fun is called
   ->few coded added and removed fo socket connection
