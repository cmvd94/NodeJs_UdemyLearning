-------------------------------------------------TYPESCRIPT----------------------------------------------------
https://www.typescriptlang.org/
BASIC :
  1. TYPESCRIPT build up on javascript
  2. TYPESCRIPT does not run in browser, typescript have to compiled to javascript and it is executed
  3. It add certain feature to the code , so for development gives better experience .(that only exsists only in development) . helps us to write better code and try to avoid unwanted error. 

installing typescript compiler , we're gonna execute in browser.(browser doesnt run typescript). so to convert typescript to javascript we need type script compiler.
npm i -g typescript //to install typescript compiler

with DENO we dont need complier .deno can run typescript . bcz TYPESCRIPT COMPILER is build inside DENO(Deno is a runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language.). 
--------------------------------------------typescript compiler-------------------------------------------------
npm i -g typescript
In terminal .. tsc app.ts  which compiles and create a app.js file(IMPORTANT when working with deno .js will not be visible , they are generated and store behind the scenes)
which is linked with .html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION:
creating configuration file
  1. in terminal tsc --init which creates tsconfig.json
  2. Once tsconfig is available. we can just execute " tsc " alone which execute all .ts files 
  3. if we specific file to compiled , then we can use tsc filename
IMPLEMENTATION:
  1. we define type for variable or for a function parameter
  2. Even though if we define variable its type and value of other type. typescript will be compiled and generate .js file. so which means , its used only in development.
  3.typescript build upon js this mean any js code work in ts file. even dom queries
  4. check image 5
  5. union type image 6
  6. check image 7 for array and obj
  7. some reptition code are hard to read. for optimisation 
       =>type:
       type alias used . which is not available in javascript
       typescript has buildin type operator
       using it we can define own type
       can also define obj
       =>interface: 
       can also define obj
       to force classes, to implement some methods/functionalities
   8. if we added a new class or constructor function . we can use CLASS name as it type . just like we used for date
   9. generic: 
       generic type simple a type that interacts with other type. eg array, object
        -> array is a type of its own ,its a list of data THATS A CORE TYPE. butit interactswith another type.
           =>array is outer type and elements in the array as inner type  
           //const numberArray: number[] = [];
            const numberArray: Array<number> = [];
            both are same. number[] is shortcut... 
        -> PROMISE
           => why promise is generic type. bcz it eventually resolve to a value. the value is resolve to that is the generic type fo the promise. for array it was the value stored in array
